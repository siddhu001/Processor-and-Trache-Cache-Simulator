1.We have assumed that for lw and sw memory address is multiple of 32
2.We have assumed that for lb and sb memory address is multiple of 8
3.We have assumed memory size=64 MB(approx)
4.We have predicted no branch in all cases and if branch occurs then we flush the two inline instructions thus creating stall 
for 2 cycles and then read instruction from the instruction memory
5.We have assumed all calculations on integer as signed unless specified otherwise.
6.We have assumed that the instruction in case the program does not come to a hault but the instrcutions have finished (like in the case of a branch at the end), we still consider the processor tries to access the instructions and included those in the Instruction Cache Access Count.
7.We have put a third data forwarding path as well (not mentioned in the book) to take of store followed by add with a data dependency. 
8.We have highlighted all the control signals in a relevant pipeline stage (As mentioned on Piazza).
